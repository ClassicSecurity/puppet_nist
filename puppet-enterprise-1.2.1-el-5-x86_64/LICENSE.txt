1. REGISTRATION; ORDERS.
1.1. Registration.  Before being permitted to access, download and/or use Puppet Labs Software, Customer must register with Puppet Labs.  Customer must provide truthful and accurate information during the registration process and keep such information current.  As part of the registration process, Customer agrees to the terms of this Agreement.
1.2. Orders.  Customer may purchase Puppet Labs Software by submitting a purchase order to Puppet Labs.  At a minimum, the order should indicate how many Nodes (defined below) Customer wishes to manage using the Puppet Labs Software.  This Agreement supersedes any conflicting provisions on such purchase order, and Puppet Labs rejects any additional provisions that it has not expressly agreed to in writing.  
2. LICENSE GRANTS.
2.1. Puppet Labs Software.  Puppet Labs Software is a collection of components, each of which Puppet Labs provides Customer under the provisions of one of the following licenses: an "open source" license ("Open Source License"), a license from a third party ("Third Party License"), or the license set forth below ("Puppet Labs License").  Puppet Labs will provide Customer with a copy of any Open Source License or Third Party License covering the Puppet Labs Software that Customer obtains under this Agreement, and Customer agrees to abide by all such provisions.  As for the Puppet Labs License, for the Term defined in Section 2.2, Puppet Labs hereby grants Customer a license to install the Puppet Labs Software covered by such license on a single computer network and use it according to its documentation to manage no more than the number of Nodes defined in Section 2.2. Puppet Labs maintains a list that shows which components of the Puppet Labs Software are governed by an Open Source License, Third-Party License or Puppet Labs License, located at www.puppetlabs.com/licenses.
2.2. Node & Term Limits.    A "Node" is a single device that is connected, in any way, to a computer network (such as, for example, a server, router, switch, IP phone, or UPS), and any virtual machine on such network that has a unique IP address.  Customer's Puppet Labs License will be limited as follows: (a) for a "Free License," Customer may use the Puppet Labs Software perpetually to manage no more than 10 Nodes on a single computer network; (b) for a "Paid License," Customer may use the Puppet Labs Software to manage the number of Nodes listed in the license file that Puppet Labs sends Customer following acceptance of Customer's purchase order (the "License File") for a period of one year from the License File date.  Any Paid License will automatically renew for consecutive one year terms unless either party elects to not renew it at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term.  Customer may not alter the information provided in a License File.  Customer may not use the Puppet Labs Software to manage more that 10 Nodes unless Puppet Labs has provided Customer with a License File that authorizes the additional Nodes.
3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  Other than as granted in Section 2, Puppet Labs and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Puppet Labs Software and all components thereof, including all patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret rights, whether such rights are registered or unregistered, and wherever in the world those rights may exist (collectively, the "Puppet Labs Rights").  Customer shall not commit any act or omission, or permit or induce any third party to commit any act or omission, inconsistent with the Puppet Labs Rights.  Puppet Labs or its licensors own all graphics, user and visual interfaces, images, code, applications, and text, as well as the design, structure, selection, coordination, expression, "look and feel", and arrangement of the Puppet Labs Software and its content, and the trademarks, service marks, proprietary logos and other distinctive brand features found in the Puppet Labs Software (collectively, the "Puppet Labs Marks").  This Agreement does not permit Customer to distribute any product or service using the Puppet Labs Marks.  Puppet Labs shall retain title to all copies of the Puppet Labs Software provided to Customer or made by Customer.  There are no implied rights or licenses in this Agreement.  All rights are expressly reserved by Puppet Labs.
4. FEES AND PAYMENT.  Customer agrees to pay Puppet Labs any fees for a Paid License within 30 days of invoice date.  All payments shall be made in currently available funds payable at the address set forth on Puppet Labs' invoice.  All amounts payable shall be in the currency of the United States and specifically exclude (and Customer is responsible for) any and all applicable sales, use and other taxes (other than taxes based on Puppet Labs' income).  Any overdue amounts are subject to a late payment charge of the lower of 1.5% per month and the highest interest rate permitted by applicable law.  All fees are non-refundable.
5. SUPPORT; CHANGES; WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER.
5.1. Support and Maintenance.  Provided Customer has purchased a Paid License, Puppet labs will provide Customer the support and maintenance services listed at http://www.puppetlabs.com/support-terms/, at either the "Basic" or the "Premium" level, as indicated in the Puppet Labs invoice.  There is no support or maintenance for a Free License.
5.2. Changes.  Any changes that Customer makes to the Puppet Labs Software may result in such software failing to operate as expected.  Puppet Labs is not responsible or liable for any such failure.
5.3. General Warranty.  Each party represents and warrants that: (a) it has the full power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to carry out its obligations under this Agreement; and (b) it has complied, and will in the future comply, with all applicable laws in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.
5.4. Limited Warranty.  Puppet Labs warrants that the Puppet Labs Software (excluding any Third Party Software) will perform in all material respects as specified in its accompanying documentation under normal use for a period of thirty (30) calendar days from initial receipt or access.  This warranty extends only to Customer.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Customer's exclusive remedy for a breach of this limited warranty is to return any allegedly defective Puppet Labs Software and Puppet Labs, at its option, will replace it or refund any fee paid for the Puppet Labs Software.  Third Party Software is governed by the warranty listed in the Third Party License.
5.5. Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 5.3 (GENERAL) AND 5.4 (LIMITED WARRANTY), PUPPET LABS DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PUPPET LABS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES (WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY) OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY AND THOSE THAT MAY ARISE FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE.
6. INDEMNIFICATION BY PUPPET LABS.  Puppet Labs agrees to indemnify and defend Customer from and against any and all damages, liens, fines, penalties, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively, "Losses") directly arising from any causes of action, suits or claims of a third party (collectively "Claims") that the Puppet Labs Software actually or allegedly infringes or misappropriates any United States copyright or trademark.  The foregoing obligation is conditioned on Customer notifying Puppet Labs promptly in writing of such Claim, Customer giving Puppet Labs sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations, and Customer cooperating and, at Puppet Labs' reasonable request and expense, assisting in such defense.  If, as a result of a Claim, or a Claim that is reasonably anticipated by Puppet Labs, Customer's use of the Puppet Labs Software is or may be temporarily or permanently enjoined or otherwise legally prevented or prohibited, Puppet Labs will, at Puppet Labs' sole option, either: (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using the affected materials in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (b) modify the materials so as to make them non-infringing, provided that the modified materials continue to substantially conform to all applicable documentation; or (c)  if neither of the foregoing are reasonably available or commercially practical, Puppet Labs will refund the portion of the fees paid by Customer for the affected materials depreciated on a five (5) year straight line basis.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Puppet Labs will have no obligation, under this Section 6 or otherwise, with respect to any infringement claim based upon or otherwise relating to: (i) any unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of any Puppet Labs Software; (ii) any use of Puppet Labs Software in combination with other products, services, equipment, software, or data not supplied by Puppet Labs; (iii) any modification of Puppet Labs Software by any person other than Puppet Labs or its authorized agents or contractors; or (iv) any Third Party Software.   This Section 6 states Puppet Labs' entire liability and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for infringement Claims and Losses.
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
7.1. INDIRECT DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL PUPPET LABS, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "PUPPET LABS PARTIES") BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, RELIANCE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING ANY DAMAGE TO BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR LOST SAVINGS), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE PUPPET LABS SOFTWARE, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PUPPET LABS PARTIES ARE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7.2. AGGREGATE LIABILITY.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PUPPET LABS PARTIES' TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER IN CONNECTION WITH THE PUPPET LABS SOFTWARE EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, THE GREATER OF: (A) THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID TO PUPPET LABS BY CUSTOMER FOR SUCH SOFTWARE AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY OCCURS AND (B) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500).
7.3. GENERAL. THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY EVEN IF THIS SECTION 7 IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY.  IN SUCH EVENT, THE LIABILITY OF THE PUPPET LABS PARTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
8. INSPECTION.  During the term of this Agreement and for one year thereafter, Puppet Labs or its designated agent may inspect Customer's facilities and records to verify Customer's compliance with this Agreement.  Any such inspection will take place only during normal business hours and upon not less than ten business days written notice.  Customer shall reasonably cooperate with the inspection, making such personnel and records available as Puppet Labs may reasonably request.  If the inspection reveals that Customer has been using the Puppet Labs Software beyond Customer's license under this Agreement, Customer will pay Puppet Labs immediately for such excess use.  If such additional payment exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Puppet Labs Software fees previously paid by Customer for the period during which such excess use occurred, Customer will also pay Puppet Labs for the cost of the inspection.
9. EXPORT CONTROL.

If acquired by or on behalf of a civilian agency, the U.S. Government acquires this commercial computer software and/or commercial computer software documentation subject to the terms of this Agreement as specified in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Computer Software) and 12.11 (Technical Data) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and its successors.  If acquired by or on behalf of any agency within the Department of Defense, the U.S. Government acquires this commercial computer software and/or commercial computer software documentation subject to the terms of this Agreement as specified in 48 C.F.R. 227.7202 of the DOD FAR Supplement and its successors.
11. TERMINATION. This Agreement lasts until one of the following occurs: (a) Customer or Puppet Labs materially breaches any term or condition of this Agreement (unless they cure the breach within 30 days of notice of opportunity to cure); or (b) Customer stops using the Puppet Labs Software and uninstalls it from Customer's computer systems.  Puppet Labs is not required to refund any amount for an unused Term.  The following terms survive termination:3, 5.5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.  Customer's continued use of any Puppet Labs Software that is governed by an Open Source License or Third Party License is governed by the provisions of those agreements.
12. GENERAL.  The laws of the State of Oregon, U.S.A., govern this Agreement (without regard to Oregon conflict of laws rules and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or any other act derived from or related to UCITA).  Customer agrees to resolve all disputes, claims and controversies arising from or relating to this Agreement in the state or federal courts located in Multnomah County, Oregon, and Customer irrevocably waives any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction.   Customer agrees that any breach of Section 3 or other infringement or misappropriation of the Puppet Labs Rights will result in immediate and irreparable damage to Puppet Labs for which there is no adequate remedy at law.  Customer is not allowed to assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or Customer's rights hereunder, whether by merger, acquisition, sale of assets, operation of law, or otherwise, without in each and every case, the prior written consent of Puppet Labs.  Any attempted assignment, transfer or delegation in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of the parties.  Customer and Puppet Labs may only amend or modify this Agreement, or waive any right under this Agreement, in a writing that is signed by both parties and that expressly references this Agreement.  In the event that any court holds any provision of this Agreement as null, void or otherwise ineffective or invalid, such provision shall be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties in accordance with applicable law, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions.  Headings are used in this Agreement for reference only and will not be considered when interpreting this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, "includes" (or "including") means without limitation.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements or communications.
