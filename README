This git repository contains the NIST Puppet Reference Materials,
which are an excellent implementation of the NSA's "Guide to the secure 
configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5". The guide can be found 
in this repository at:
https://github.com/mcgonagletom/puppet_nist/blob/master/additional_materials/rhel5-guide-i731.pdf

The original NIST materials can be found at:
http://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/rhel/download_rhel5.html

This repository also includes a basic 10 client licensed distribution of 
Puppet Enterprise from Puppet Laboratories:
http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise/

This repository was designed to educate and demonstrate the power of Puppet.

A Vagrant CentOS 5.7 VirtualBox VM was purpose built to demonstrate the 
NIST Puppet Modules. The Vagrant package is distirbuted via a different
means from the modules, due to size limitations with Github. 
The vagrant package can be found at:
https://s3.amazon.com/tomsfiles/vagrant/package.box
